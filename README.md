## Example output
Rating: {'viewability': 9, 'brand_safety_risk': 8, 'invalid_traffic': 10, 'out_of_geo': 86}

Recommendation: Out-of-geo has performed exceptionally well with a rating of 86, indicating excellent in-geo performance. However, there is room for improvement in brand safety risk, which received a rating of 8, suggesting potential risks to our brand. 

To enhance brand safety, we recommend implementing stricter measures such as reviewing the domain/app list from our partners to identify any potential issues. It is crucial to remove high-volume domains with a brand safety risk of more than 10% from our inclusion lists. Additionally, introducing brand safety risk blocking will help mitigate any potential risks.

In terms of viewability, which received a rating of 9, we suggest focusing on placement selection and in-flight optimization to further improve performance. By carefully selecting the right ad placements and continuously optimizing our campaigns during flight, we can enhance viewability and ensure that our video ads are viewed for longer durations.

Furthermore, to address invalid traffic (rating: 10), we recommend reducing desktop inventory by 26% to improve compliance with invalid traffic (IVT) standards. Introducing IVT blocking measures will also help combat fraudulent domain hijacking and further enhance the quality of our traffic.

Overall, it is essential to review our in-geo targeting capabilities and set up benchmarks for the DACH region. By continuously monitoring and optimizing our campaigns based on these recommendations, we can maximize performance, mitigate brand safety risks, and ensure optimal viewability and traffic quality.
